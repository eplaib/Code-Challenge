# Processing mRNA Sequence

## Challenge

This is a possible solution for the Code Challenge. This one is written in Python. This program reads a string or a file that contains a string as input. The input string is a sequence of mRNA which may contain whitespace characters (space, tab, linefeed, Unicode whitespace) that are ignored. The string may also contain comments prefixed with “>” (greater then) character. All data after that character until the end of the line is ignored.
